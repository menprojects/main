This is just an overview to describe the setup.
In this directory will be notes how to setup ops manager, ansible, AWS,


1. 4 OPS Managers
   a.master, dev, qa, prod
   b. Use? Automation, Backups, and Monitoring

2. Automation: Jenkins, Ansible, Redt API, and Python scripts
   a. NOTE: Ansible is written in Python and the REST API can use Python.
     So one main programming language.

3. Security
   a. LDAP, SSL, Kerberos, etc. Some Sys Admin work involved here. 
   b. You should use encryption at rest
   c. Auditing would be nice.

The directories here should be:
servers
  opsmanager
    For purposes you may not use ops manager because it is for
    backups, monitoring, and it can be taken care of in other
    ways. Have ansible make nagios alarms and cronjobs for backups. 
  ansible
    ubuntu
    mongo
  jenkins CI/CD
  apache Spark -- read data from mongo to perform actions
    This one will be last. 
and thee directories will contain config, howto docs, and code.
